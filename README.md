📅 Social Media Scheduler – User Guide

Thank you for using the Social Media Scheduler!
This app helps you plan, schedule, and manage posts for TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook directly from your computer.

🖥️ What You Can Do

Schedule posts for TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook.

Start and stop the scheduler whenever you want.

Add new posts while the app is running.

Generate daily reports of your scheduled and published posts.

Exit safely (the app will stop scheduling and create a final report).

🚀 How to Start

Double-click the application file (SocialMediaScheduler.jar) to open it.

The Dashboard window will appear.

When the app starts, it will automatically load posts from the prepared file (posts.json).

📂 The Dashboard

You will see:

A list of posts (loaded or added).

Several buttons at the bottom.

Buttons Explained

▶ Start Scheduler → starts scheduling all posts.

⏹ Stop Scheduler → stops the scheduler.

➕ Add Post → create a new post with platform, content, and time.

📄 Generate Report → creates a daily report of all posts.

🚪 Safe Exit → safely close the app (scheduler stops and a final report is created).

The status bar at the bottom shows whether the scheduler is running (green) or stopped (red).

➕ Adding a Post

Click Add Post.

A form will open:

Platform → choose TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook.

Content → type your post content.

Time (HH:mm) → enter the time you want it posted (e.g., 14:00).

Click OK.

The post will be added to the list.

📄 Generating Reports

Click Generate Report at any time.

A file will be saved showing all scheduled and published posts for the day.

🚪 Safe Exit

Always use the Safe Exit button (or close the window).

The scheduler will stop.

A final report will be created automatically.

Then the app will close.

✅ Tips

If you add a post while the scheduler is stopped, it will not be scheduled until you press Start Scheduler.

Make sure your system clock is correct, as posts are scheduled by time.

Reports are saved automatically in the app folder.
